axiom unsafeNonzero {α} [Zero α] (a : α) : a ≠ 0

/-- This tactic is used to ignore common assumptions of differentiation rules when used as discharger
in `autodiff` tactic.

Most notably, it assumes that every humber is non-zero thus you can freely differentiate through
division, norm, logarithm etc.

TODO: Add differentiation rules for if statement where the condition depends on the value and
      make this tactic compatible with this rule.
